HomeKitBridge
=============
HomeKit Bridge is a project that allows app developers test their HomeKit app with real hardware using Mac as a relay to communicate with accessory that doesn't support HomeKit protocol.

This project uses Apple's private framework "HAPAccessoryKit" which comes with HomeKit Accessory Simulator.

**You will need to put HomeKit Accessory Simulator.app under /Applications/ to build this project. (It comes with Hardware IO Tools which you can find from [here](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action))**

Currently the project only supports Philips Hue Light.
